I am going to make a list of questions I would need to find answers to later when there is some free time.

## H2 1. What is CUDA

CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model that makes using a GPU for general purpose computing simple and elegant.
In Layman terms,
Using CUDA, one can utilize the power of Nvidia GPUs to perform general computing tasks,
such as multiplying matrices and performing other linear algebra operations, instead of just doing graphical calculations. 
Using CUDA, developers can now harness the potential of the GPU for general purpose computing.

CUDA âˆ’ Compute Unified Device Architecture. It is an extension of C programming, an API model for parallel computing created by Nvidia. 
Programs written using CUDA harness the power of GPU. Thus, increasing the computing performance.
